# Chicago Public Health Analysis

This investigation aims to identify correlations between various public health indicators across Chicago's community areas. By highlighting areas lacking essential resources, the analysis can pinpoint regions where public policy or legislative action may be necessary. The goal is to uncover communities disproportionately affected by these health indicators, guiding targeted improvements and better allocation of funds to areas with higher vulnerability.
